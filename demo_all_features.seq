# Sequentia Demo: All Features Showcase
# Demonstrates vector arithmetic, slicing, conditionals, and loops

# 1. Generate Fibonacci sequence
fib = pattern fibonacci 10
print fib

# 2. Vector Arithmetic: Scalar Broadcast
doubled = fib * 2
print doubled

# 3. Slicing: Extract middle portion
middle = fib[2:5]
print middle

# 4. For Loop & Conditional
for val in middle {
    if val > 4 {
        print val
    }
}
