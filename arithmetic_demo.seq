# Arithmetic Pattern Demo
# Syntax: variable = pattern arithmetic start, step, count

# Example 1: Simple arithmetic sequence starting at 5, step 3
seq1 = pattern arithmetic 5, 3, 6
print seq1

# Example 2: Even numbers (start at 0, step 2)
evens = pattern arithmetic 0, 2, 10
print evens

# Example 3: Counting by 10s
tens = pattern arithmetic 10, 10, 5
print tens
