# Test file for for loops
# Tests basic loops, nested loops, and loops with conditions

# Basic for loop
fib = pattern fibonacci 8
for num in fib {
    print num
}

# For loop with condition
squares = pattern square 10
for val in squares {
    if val > 25 {
        print val
    }
}

# Nested for loops
x = pattern fibonacci 5
y = pattern square 3
for a in x {
    for b in y {
        sum = a + b
        print sum
    }
}

# For loop with arithmetic inside
nums = pattern arithmetic 1, 2, 6
for n in nums {
    doubled = n * 2
    print doubled
}
